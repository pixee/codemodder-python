This codemod relies on an external dependency. We have automatically added this dependency to your project's `{filename}` file.

There are a number of places where Python project dependencies can be expressed, including `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, and `requirements.txt` files. If this change is incorrect, or if you are using another packaging system such as `poetry`, it may be necessary for you to manually add the dependency to the proper location in your project.

## Dependency Updates

This codemod relies on an external dependency. However, we were unable to automatically add the dependency to your project. 

{description} 

There are a number of places where Python project dependencies can be expressed, including `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, and `requirements.txt` files. You may need to manually add this dependency to the proper location in your project.

### Manual Installation

For `setup.py`:
```diff
 install_requires=[
+    "{requirement}",
 ],
```

For `pyproject.toml` (using `setuptools`):
```diff
[project]
dependencies = [
+    "{requirement}",
]
```

For `setup.cfg`:
```diff
[options]
install_requires =
+    {requirement}
```

For `requirements.txt`:
```diff
+{requirement}
```

For more information on adding dependencies to `setuptools` projects, see [the setuptools documentation](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#declaring-required-dependency). 

If you are using another build system, please refer to the documentation for that system to determine how to add dependencies.
