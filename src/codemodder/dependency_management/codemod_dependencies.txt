# This is a temporary solution to use dependabot to alert us
# when the dependencies our codemods inject (for example `security`, `defusedxml`, etc) have a version update.

# If this file gets a dependabot update PR, we must also update the corresponding
# dependency in dependency.py. Be sure to update the version AND the hashes.
# Run `get-hashes pkg==version` to get the hashes.
