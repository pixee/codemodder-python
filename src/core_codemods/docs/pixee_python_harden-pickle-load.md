Python's `pickle` module is notoriouly insecure. While it is very useful for serializing and deserializing Python objects, it is not safe to use `pickle` to load data from untrusted sources. This is because `pickle` can execute arbitrary code when loading data. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on your system. Unlike `yaml` there is no concept of a "safe" loader in `pickle`. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid `pickle` and to use a different serialization format such as `json` or `yaml` when working with untrusted data.

However, if you must use `pickle` to load data from an untrusted source, we recommend using the open-source `fickling` library. `fickling` is a drop-in replacement for `pickle` that validates the data before loading it and checks for the possibility of code execution. This makes it much safer (although still not entirely safe) to use `pickle` to load data from untrusted sources.

This codemod replaces calls to `pickle.load` with `fickling.load` in Python code. It also adds an import statement for `fickling` if it is not already present. 

The changes look like the following:
```diff
- import pickle
+ import fickling
 
- data = pickle.load(file)
+ data = fickling.load(file)
```
