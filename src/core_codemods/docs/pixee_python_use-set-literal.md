This codemod converts Python set constructions using literal list arguments into more efficient and readable set literals. It simplifies expressions like `set([1, 2, 3])` to `{1, 2, 3}`, enhancing both performance and code clarity.

Our changes look like this:
```diff
-x = set([1, 2, 3])
+x = {1, 2, 3}
```
