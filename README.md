# codemodder-python

Framework for applying [codemods](https://codemodder.io/) to Python projects.

## Development Status

The `codemodder-python` project is still under development. üöß

The project includes a (growing) set of core codemods. It also supports the
development of custom codemods.

Many of the existing codemods make use of [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/). The
`codemodder-python` framework will support additional codemod sources in the
future.

‚ö†Ô∏è  The custom codemod API is under heavy development and is subject to change.
The API should not be treated as stable at this time. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Installation

To install the package from source, use `pip`:

```
pip install .
```

## Running Locally

You can run the codemodder program with

```codemodder <directory> --output <file> ...```

```bash
codemodder --help
```
